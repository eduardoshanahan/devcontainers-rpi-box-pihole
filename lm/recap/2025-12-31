# 2025-12-31

- Added `pihole_api_max_sessions` env lookup to `rpi_box_01.yml` and `rpi_box_02.yml`.
- Removed duplicate `PIHOLE_API_MAX_SESSIONS` entry from `.env`.
- Next run should deploy the updated sync script that retries host updates with single-segment encoding to avoid 404s.
- Added a wait for `pihole.toml` initialization before setting `webserver.api.max_sessions`.
- Set `webserver.api.max_sessions = 64` on both nodes, restarted Pi-hole, and reran the playbook successfully.
