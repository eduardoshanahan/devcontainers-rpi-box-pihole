- Created daily state, plans, and recap files.
- Inspected both Pi-hole hosts and found DNS queries rejected as non-local after enabling Traefik with bridge networking.
- Identified Pi-hole listening mode set to LOCAL and updated the Ansible template to set dns.listeningMode to ALL when Traefik is enabled on bridge networks.
- Deployed the updated role and confirmed DNS resolution for both Pi-hole hosts and external domains via dig tests.
