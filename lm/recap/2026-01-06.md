# 2026-01-06

- Fixed Pi-hole sync list diff to avoid unhashable dict crashes by normalizing entries before set comparisons.
- Added env-backed host vars for PIHOLE_SYNC_PRIMARY_HOSTNAME, PIHOLE_SYNC_LOCAL_API_HOSTNAME/IP, and all PIHOLE_ALERT_* settings.
- Updated .env/.env.example to include the alert peer host and web URL fields required by role assertions.
