- Implement fixes from review findings (sync list diff handling, env wiring for sync/alerts).
- Ensure .env and .env.example reflect required alert and sync variables.
- Provide next-step guidance for running playbook or smoke checks if needed.
- Adjust sync/alert implementation so alert configuration does not rely on global env variables, enabling per-secondary Pi-hole settings.
- Add a Traefik presence check before deploying Pi-hole when Traefik integration is enabled.
