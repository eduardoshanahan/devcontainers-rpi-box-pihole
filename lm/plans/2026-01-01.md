- Review current Pi-hole/Traefik configs and DNS topology to define expected behavior and identify likely conflicts.
- Collect evidence on the Pi-hole hosts (containers, port bindings, logs, DNS queries) to reproduce the failure.
- Check the secondary box for the same DNS listening issue or extra deltas.
- Update Ansible so Traefik-enabled deployments set Pi-hole DNS listening safely; redeploy and re-test.
