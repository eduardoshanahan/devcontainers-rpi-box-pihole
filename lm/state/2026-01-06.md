- Start of day: reviewed repo and Pi-hole role behavior per request.
- Changes: fixed Pi-hole sync list diff logic to handle dict entries safely; wired missing sync/alert env vars into host vars.
- Updates: aligned .env and .env.example to include alert peer URL/hostname/IP fields required by role assertions.
- Current status: changes applied; ready for follow-up review or testing on target hosts.
