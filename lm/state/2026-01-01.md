- Start of day: status pending; no changes recorded yet.
- Investigation: checked Pi-hole and Traefik containers on both boxes and found DNS queries rejected as "non-local".
- Finding: Pi-hole v6 running on bridge network with Traefik had dns.listeningMode=LOCAL, so LAN queries were ignored.
- Fix: updated Ansible to set dns.listeningMode=ALL when Traefik+bridge is enabled, corrected the env var name to FTLCONF_dns_listeningMode, and added deployment DNS smoke tests.
- Result: Ansible deploy completed successfully on both boxes; DNS smoke tests passed.
