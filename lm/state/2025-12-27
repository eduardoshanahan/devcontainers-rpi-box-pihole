- The repo deploys app stacks to pre-provisioned Raspberry Pi hosts via Ansible.
- Primary playbook: `src/playbooks/pi-apps.yml` targets the `raspberry_pi_boxes` group.
- Current app role is `pihole`, which renders a docker-compose file and runs it.
- Required variables are sourced from `.env`/host vars (`pihole_*`, `ANSIBLE_*`).
- Health check hits `http://localhost:<pihole_web_port>/admin/` when enabled.
